#StyleLike
This project is made to showcase my frontend skill.
The design follows the given style guide.
The campaign statistics is purposely hidden on smaller screen device to keep relevant information visible for users.

According to the task description, the application was built to be responsive on mobile screens.
The presented data is mocked data from JSON file.

It would have been nice to implement the following features:
- add a new campaign
- accept or decline tasks
- add to favorites

The application is currently deployed on Heroku:
